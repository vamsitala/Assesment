1. I have created a controller which I named stored class.
2. In the stored class we have all the methods which I have developed in the store.java class.
3. The user will start working with the test.Java. In the test, the class user will create an object for the stored.
4. By using the object there is an internal data transfer will happen by calling those methods with the obj.
