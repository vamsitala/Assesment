I have created a two java classes.
TestFile.
Store.

TestFile: It has a main method where we can call the Store class methods and we will use it here.

Store: I have creates multiple methods in this class.
I have used 2 hashmaps one to get the unique values for the string and another is to get the count based on the calls.
Hashforcount.
Hashforunique.
getrandom() → It is used to generate a random number, the number is used in the Hashforunique.
StoreUrl(String str) → It is used for storing the string in both hashmaps.
list() → It is used to print the Hashforcount.
getUnique(String str) → The command get shall take a URL as a parameter and return the unique short key after incrementing the usage count.
count(String str) → The command count shall take a URL as a parameter and should return the latest usage count.
updateValue(String url) → It is used to update the count value whenever a get call is happen.
